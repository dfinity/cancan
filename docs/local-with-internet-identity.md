# Local Development with internet-identity

Follow these steps to run cancan locally along with locally running [dfinity/internet-identity](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity) canisters on the same replica.

## Overview

The internet-identity canisters must be running on the same IC replica as the CanCan canisters.
As long as both internet-identity and cancan's `local` network are running on the default port, this is pretty easy.

CanCan must then be accessed in such a way that it uses the local internet-identity canisters to log in instead of the product internet-identity canisters.

## Steps

1. Follow the CanCan [README](../README.md) to start a local replica, deploy CanCan, and opn the app to the sign in screen.
2. Clone the git repo for https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity to another directory
3. Ensure you have the correct dependencies to build internet-identity (e.g. `rustc@1.51.0` at time of this writing)
5. Deploy internet-identity like:
    ```
    II_ENV=development dfx deploy --no-wallet --argument '(null)'
    ```
    * Explanation of command
        * `II_ENV=development` is configures internet-identity to know it is running on a development replica.
        * `dfx deploy --no-wallet --argument '(null)'` is from the internet-identity README
    * When the deploy succeeds, take note of the canister id of internet-identity. You should be able to access internet-identity via a URL like `http://{canisters.internet-identity.id}.localhost:8000/`
6. Access CanCan with URL querystring parameter `internetIdentityUrl` set to the local URL of internet-identity on the local replica, e.g. `http://ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai.localhost:8000/sign-in?internetIdentityUrl=http://rno2w-sqaaa-aaaaa-aaacq-cai.localhost:8000/`
7. Click 'Authorize' and follow the prompts in the CanCan + internet-identity web pages.
